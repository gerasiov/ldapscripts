Description: Add and remove users and groups (stored in a LDAP directory)
 Ldapscripts are shell scripts that allow management of POSIX accounts (users,
 groups, machines) in a LDAP directory. They are similar to smbldap-tools
 but are written in shellscript, not Perl.
 .
 They only require OpenLDAP client commands (ldapadd, ldapdelete, ldapsearch,
 ldapmodify, ldappasswd) and make administrator's work a lot easier avoiding
 the need to configure Perl and each library dependency (e.g. Net::LDAP).
 .
 These scripts are very simple to configure by not requiring any Samba-related
 information (SID, profiles, homes, etc): management of Samba attributes is
 entirely done by standard commands (net, smbpasswd and pdbedit) used together
 with the scripts. Moreover, most of the configuration is guessed from the
 one of nslcd, and everything should work out from the box for most users.
 .
 The scripts may be used independently - within command lines - or
 automatically by Samba (like smbldap-tools), to handle POSIX information
 within accounts before adding Samba information.
